1. Upload the CIFAR-10 dataset whuch consists of more complex images in RGB instead of Grayscale

2. The data is normalized pixel values to [0,1]

3. Reduces images from 32x32 -> 16x16 and process through filters

4. 50% randomly turns off half neurons. This prevenets overfitting, generalizes  well unseen data.

5. Output data to a graph.

6. Requires vertual environment of MacOS
